Two optimization algorithm for nonlinear problems.

## Function Files

**inversion_LM.m** The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
  
**inversion_pso.m** Particle swarm optimization algorithm

Here, the inverse problem is posed as an standard overdetermined optimization problem, and the regularization is not considered.

## Example

**test2_LM.m** A test of the inversion of 1D MT data for resistivity values and thickness of each layers using LM method.

**test2_pso.m** A test of the inversion of 1D MT data for resistivity values and thickness of each layers using LM method.
